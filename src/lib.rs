//! ERDOS is a platform for developing self-driving car and robotics
//! applications. The system is built using techniques from streaming dataflow
//! systems which is reflected by the API.
//!
//! Applications are modeled as directed graphs, in which data flows through
//! [streams](crate::dataflow::stream) and is processed by
//! [operators](crate::dataflow::Operator).
//! Because applications often resemble a sequence of connected operators,
//! an ERDOS application may also be referred to as a *pipeline*.
//!
//! ## Example
//! This example shows an ERDOS application which counts the number of objects
//! detected from a stream of camera frames.
//! The example consists of the [driver](#driver) part of the program, which
//! is responsible for connecting operators via streams.
//! For information on building operators, see [ยง Operators](#operators).
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // Capture arguments to set up an ERDOS node.
//! let args = erdos::new_app("ObjectCounter");
//! // Create an ERDOS node which runs the application.
//! let mut node = Node::new(Configuration::from_args(args));
//!
//! // Stream of RGB images from a camera.
//! let camera_frames = erdos::connect_1_write!(
//!     CameraOperator,
//!     OperatorConfig::new().name("Camera")
//! );
//! // Stream of labeled bounding boxes for each RGB image.
//! let detected_objects = erdos::connect_1_write!(
//!     ObjectDetector,
//!     OperatorConfig::new().name("Detector"),
//!     camera_stream
//! );
//! // Stream of detected object count for each RGB image.
//! let num_detected = erdos::connect_1_write!(
//!     MapOperator,
//!     OperatorConfig::new()
//!         .name("Counter")
//!         .arg(|bboxes: &Vec<BBox>| -> usize { bbxes.len() }),
//!     detected_objects
//! );
//!
//! // Run the application
//! node.run();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Driver
//! The *driver* section of the program connects operators together using
//! streams to build an ERDOS application which may then be executed.
//! The driver is typically the `main` function in `main.rs`.
//!
//! The driver may also interact with a running ERDOS application.
//! Using the [`IngestStream`](crate::dataflow::stream::IngestStream),
//! the driver can send data to operators on a stream.
//! The [`ExtractStream`](crate::dataflow::stream::ExtractStream)
//! allows the driver to read data sent from an operator.
//!
//! ## Streams
//! Data is broadcast to all receivers when sending on an ERDOS stream.
//! Streams are typed on their data, and expose 2 classes of interfaces
//! that access the underlying stream:
//! 1. Read-interfaces expose methods to receive and process data.
//!    They allow pulling data by calling
//!    [`read()`](crate::dataflow::stream::ReadStream::read) and
//!    [`try_read()`](crate::dataflow::stream::ReadStream::try_read).
//!    Often, they also support a push data model accessed by registering
//!    callbacks (e.g.
//!    [`add_callback`](crate::dataflow::stream::ReadStream::add_callback) and
//!    [`add_watermark_callback`](crate::dataflow::stream::ReadStream::add_watermark_callback)).
//!    Structures that implement read interfaces include:
//!    - [`ReadStream`](crate::dataflow::stream::ReadStream):
//!      used by operators to read data and register callbacks.
//!    - [`ExtractStream`](crate::dataflow::stream::ExtractStream):
//!      used by the driver to read data.
//! 2. Write-interfaces expose the
//!    [`send`](crate::dataflow::stream::WriteStreamT::send) method to send
//!    data on a stream. Structures that implement write interfaces include:
//!    - [`WriteStream`](crate::dataflow::stream::WriteStream): used by
//!      operators to send data.
//!    - [`IngestStream`](crate::dataflow::stream::IngestStream): used by
//!      the driver to send data.
//!
//! Some applications may want to introduce loops in their dataflow graphs
//! which is possible using the
//! [`LoopStream`](crate::dataflow::stream::LoopStream).
//!
//! ## Operators
//! An ERDOS operator receives data on
//! [`ReadStream`](crate::dataflow::stream::ReadStream)s,
//! and sends processed data on
//! [`WriteStream`](crate::dataflow::stream::WriteStream)s.
//! We provide a [standard library of operators](crate::dataflow::operators)
//! for common dataflow patterns.
//! While the standard operators are general and versatile, some applications
//! may implement custom operators to better optimize performance and take
//! fine-grained control over exection.
//!
//! All operators must implement `new` and `connect` methods, in addition to
//! the [`Operator`](crate::dataflow::Operator) trait.
//! - The `new` method takes an
//!   [`OperatorConfig`](crate::dataflow::OperatorConfig),
//!   all [`ReadStream`](crate::dataflow::stream::ReadStream)s from which the
//!   operator receives data, all
//!   [`WriteStream`](crate::dataflow::stream::WriteStream)s on which the
//!   operator sends data, and returns `Self`.
//!   Within `new`, the state should be initialized, and callbacks may be
//!   registered across [`ReadStream`](crate::dataflow::stream::ReadStream)s.
//! - The `connect` method takes references to the required
//!   [`ReadStream`](crate::dataflow::stream::ReadStream)s
//!   and returns [`WriteStream`](crate::dataflow::stream::WriteStream)s in the
//!   same order as in `new`.
//!
//! For an example, see the implementation of the
//! [`MapOperator`](crate::dataflow::operators::MapOperator).
//!
//! While ERDOS manages the execution of callbacks, some operators require
//! more finegrained control. Operators can take manual control over the
//! thread of execution by overriding the
//! [`run`](crate::dataflow::Operator::run) of the
//! [`Operator`](crate::dataflow::Operator) trait and pulling data from
//! [`ReadStream`](crate::dataflow::stream::ReadStream)s.
//! *Callbacks are not invoked while run executes.*
//!
//! ## Performance
//! ERDOS is designed for low latency. Self-driving car pipelines require
//! end-to-end deadlines on the order of hundreds of milliseconds for safe
//! driving. Similarly, self-driving cars typically process gigabytes per
//! second of data on small clusters. Therefore, ERDOS is optimized to
//! send small amounts of data (gigabytes as opposed to terabytes)
//! as quickly as possible.
//!
//! ## Watermarks
//! Watermarks in ERDOS signal completion of computation. More concretely,
//! sending a watermark with timestamp `t` on a stream asserts that all future
//! messages sent on that stream will have timestamps `t' > t`.
//! ERDOS also introduces a *top watermark*, which is a watermark with the
//! maximum possible timestamp. Sending a top watermark closes the stream as
//! there is no `t' > t_top`, so no more messages can be sent.
//!
//! ## Determinism
//! ERDOS provides mechanisms to enable the building of deterministic
//! applications.
//! For instance, processing sets of messages separated by watermarks using
//! watermark callbacks and
//! [time-versioned state](crate::dataflow::state::TimeVersionedState)
//! turns ERDOS pipelines into
//! [Kahn process networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahn_process_networks).
